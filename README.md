## 🔍 Project Highlights

* Performed **EDA** to understand ticket price trends by airline, route, time, and duration.
* Applied **data cleaning** (missing values, outliers, categorical handling).
* Engineered new features:

  * Extracted date/time components.
  * Duration-related features.
  * One-hot and label encoding.
* Dataset prepared for machine learning models.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* Prices vary strongly with **airline and route**.
* **Departure time** (morning vs night) impacts fares.
* **Duration** correlates with higher ticket prices.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* Python
* pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook EDA+FE-Flight.ipynb
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 📌 Next Steps

* Build ML models for flight price prediction.
* Deploy a web app for user-friendly predictions.
